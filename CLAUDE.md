# Repo notes

Multi-project repo of demo/showcase websites (one static site per client type).

## Giulivo — reference template for restaurant / fast-food sites

The user has explicitly asked to reuse **Giulivo** (`index.html`, `en.html`,
`de.html`, `assets/`) as the base style/reference for any future restaurant
or fast-food site built in this repo. When starting a new restaurant/fast-food
project, start from Giulivo's structure and adapt rather than designing from
scratch:

- Design language: dark warm palette (`--terracotta`, `--olive`, `--gold`,
  `--cream`, `--ink` in `assets/css/style.css`), `Fraunces` display serif +
  `Jost` sans-serif body, ambient glow blobs, glassmorphism navbar.
- Sections: hero, stats, story, motto, menu (with modal for full menu),
  gallery, reviews, reservation form (WhatsApp deep link), contact
  (address/hours/map), footer.
- Interactions: scroll-triggered GSAP/ScrollTrigger + Lenis smooth scroll,
  optional decorative custom cursor dot (never hide the native cursor —
  keep it additive, see git history for the bug this caused), scroll
  progress bar, mobile burger menu, language switcher.
- Plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step — keep new restaurant sites the same way
  unless asked otherwise.
- Booking/phone CTAs use `tel:` links — always add `target="_blank"
  rel="noopener"` to them (needed for the Claude artifact demo sandbox,
  harmless on a real deployed site).
